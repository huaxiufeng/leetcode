/**
 * Given an array of citations sorted in ascending order (each citation is a non-negative integer) of a researcher, write a function to compute the researcher's h-index.

 According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: "A scientist has index h if h of his/her N papers have at least h citations each, and the other N âˆ’ h papers have no more than h citations each."

 This is a follow up problem to H-Index, where citations is now guaranteed to be sorted in ascending order.
 Could you solve it in logarithmic time complexity?
